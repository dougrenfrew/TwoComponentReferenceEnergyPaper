Algorithms for the design of biomacromolecules employ ``reference energies'' to correctly weight the probability of designing particular residue types.
In the context of the twenty canonical amino acids, these quantities are typically treated as free parameters optimized to reproduce native sequences.
More general methods exist to produce reference energies for non-canonical amino acids that provide a proxy for the energy of that residue type in an ``unfolded'' state.
In this work, we develop a new two-component reference energy (TCRE) that considers the ``unfolded'' state's single-residue score terms combined with inter-residue score terms derived from high-quality protein structures.
We obtain sequence recovery that improves somewhat on that obtained from the canonical reference energy; moreover, the TCRE has a clear physical basis and can easily be used for non-canonical amino acids and residues of other foldamers.
