Algorithms for the design of biomacromolecules employ ``reference energies'' to correctly weight the probability of designing particular residue types.
In the context of canonical amino acids, these quantities are typically treated as free parameters optimized to reproduce native sequences.
More general methods exist to produce reference energies for non-canonical amino acids that provide a proxy for the energy of that residue type in an ``unfolded'' state.
In this work, we develop an extension of these general methods that considers the ``unfolded'' state's single-residue score terms combined with inter-residue score terms derived from high-quality protein structures.
In so doing, we produce a reference energy that yields sequence recovery comparable to the canonical-only framework but that possesses a clear physical basis, and which is entirely extensible to non-canonical amino acids and other foldamer residues.
