\subsection{Grid search weight fitting}
First we did a grid search with a whole bunch of atom types and statistical methods, and found that unique and median were the best.

TABLE Performance by atom type set/statistical method? Probably just by atom type set. And how to represent this?

Then, we went and did more grid searching on just the best candidate atom type sets for CAA and NCAA. We got some landscape:

FIGURE heatmap from grid search, talaris and mm std both I think.


\subsection{optE Sucks}
We then used optE and it sucked.

\subsection{new-optE performance}
Then we made it better. 

This (hopefully) gave us better numbers that were <some amount> different from the gridsearch, thus validating the months it took to do.


FIGURE Sequence recovery by amino acid type resulting from this, similar to what Doug did for the Rosettacon poster.
