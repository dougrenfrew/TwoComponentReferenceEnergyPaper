\section{Atom types only found in NCAAs}
A limited number of atom types found in NCAAs currently implemented in Rosetta are not found in canonical amino acids, and thus cannot be scored using the Top8000 data set.
To obtain expected energy distributions for these atom types, which include e.g. the halogens, we mutated all instances of a canonical residue type to a noncanonical analogue that includes the atom type in question and performed limited rotamer repacking and mimimization to resolve clashes.
We analyzed the resulting scoring term distributions in the same way.
Table \ref{suptab:atypes_all} describes the molecular mechanics atom types which had to be evaluated in this way.


%Probably want to trim this to just NCAA atom types and/or move it to the supplement...
