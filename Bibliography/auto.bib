We have recently completed a full rearchitecturing of the Rosetta molecular modeling program, generalizing and expanding its existing functionality. The new architecture enables the rapid prototyping of novel protocols by providing easy-to-use interfaces to powerful tools for molecular modeling. The source code of this rearchitecturing has been released as Rosetta3 and is freely available for academic use. At the time of its release, it contained 470,000 lines of code. Counting currently unpublished protocols at the time of this writing, the source includes 1,285,000 lines. Its rapid growth is a testament to its ease of use. This chapter describes the requirements for our new architecture, justifies the design decisions, sketches out central classes, and highlights a few of the common tasks that the new software can perform.},

Accurate energy functions are critical to macromolecular modeling and design. We describe new tools for identifying inaccuracies in energy functions and guiding their improvement, and illustrate the application of these tools to the improvement of the Rosetta energy function. The feature analysis tool identifies discrepancies between structures deposited in the {PDB} and low-energy structures generated by Rosetta; these likely arise from inaccuracies in the energy function. The {optE} tool optimizes the weights on the different components of the energy function by maximizing the recapitulation of a wide range of experimental observations. We use the tools to examine three proposed modifications to the Rosetta energy function: improving the unfolded state energy model (reference energies), using bicubic spline interpolation to generate knowledge-based torisonal potentials, and incorporating the recently developed Dunbrack 2010 rotamer library (Shapovalov \&amp; Dunbrack, 2011).},

	abstract = {De novo protein design requires the identification of amino-acid sequences that favor the target-folded conformation and are soluble in water. One strategy for promoting solubility is to disallow hydrophobic residues on the protein surface during design. However, naturally occurring proteins often have hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that contribute to protein stability via the partial burial of hydrophobic surface area or play a key role in the formation of protein–protein interactions. A less restrictive approach for surface design that is used by the modeling program Rosetta is to parameterize the energy function so that the number of hydrophobic amino acids designed on the protein surface is similar to what is observed in naturally occurring monomeric proteins. Previous studies with Rosetta have shown that this limits surface hydrophobics to the naturally occurring frequency (∼ 28\%), but that it does not prevent the formation of hydrophobic patches that are considerably larger than those observed in naturally occurring proteins. Here, we describe a new score term that explicitly detects and penalizes the formation of hydrophobic patches during computational protein design. With the new term, we are able to design protein surfaces that include hydrophobic amino acids at naturally occurring frequencies, but do not have large hydrophobic patches. By adjusting the strength of the new score term, the emphasis of surface redesigns can be switched between maintaining solubility and maximizing folding free energy.

	abstract = {The development of the {EGAD} program and energy function for protein design is described. In contrast to most protein design methods, which require several empirical parameters or heuristics such as patterning of residues or rotamers, {EGAD} has a minimalist philosophy; it uses very few empirical factors to account for inaccuracies resulting from the use of fixed backbones and discrete rotamers in protein design calculations, and describes the unfolded state, aggregates, and alternative conformers explicitly with physical models instead of fitted parameters. This approach unveils important issues in protein design that are often camouflaged by heuristic-emphasizing methods. Inter-atom energies are modeled with the {OPLS}-{AA} all-atom forcefield, electrostatics with the generalized Born continuum model, and the hydrophobic effect with a solvent-accessible surface area-dependent term. Experimental characterization of proteins designed with an unmodified version of the energy function revealed problems with under-packing, stability, aggregation, and structural specificity. Under-packing was addressed by modifying the van der Waals function. By optimizing only three parameters, the effects of \&gt;400 mutations on protein–protein complex formation were predicted to within 1.0 kcal mol−1. As an independent test, this modified energy function was used to predict the stabilities of \&gt;1500 mutants to within 1.0 kcal mol−1; this required a physical model of the unfolded state that includes more interactions than traditional tripeptide-based models. Solubility and structural specificity were addressed with simple physical approximations of aggregation and conformational equilibria. The complete energy function can design protein sequences that have high levels of identity with their natural counterparts, and have predicted structural properties more consistent with soluble and uniquely folded proteins than the initial designs.},

Starting from random sequences, low free energy sequences were generated for 108 protein backbone structures by using a Monte Carlo optimization procedure and a free energy function based primarily on Lennard–Jones packing interactions and the Lazaridis–Karplus implicit solvation model. Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51\% of the core residues and 27\% of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large {SH}3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for {SH}3 domain structures. Taken together, these results suggest that the volume of sequence space optimal for a protein structure is surprisingly restricted to a region around the native sequence.},

Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction. In the Rosetta method, short fragments of known proteins are assembled by a Monte Carlo strategy to yield native-like protein conformations. Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ Cα root mean square deviation ({RMSD}) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima. The effectiveness of conformation modification operators for energy function optimization is also described in this chapter.},

	<p>Flexible peptides that fold upon binding to another protein molecule mediate a large number of regulatory interactions in the living cell and may provide highly specific recognition modules. We present Rosetta FlexPepDock <italic>ab-initio</italic>, a protocol for simultaneous docking and <italic>de-novo</italic> folding of peptides, starting from an approximate specification of the peptide binding site. Using the Rosetta fragments library and a coarse-grained structural representation of the peptide and the receptor, FlexPepDock <italic>ab-initio</italic> samples efficiently and simultaneously the space of possible peptide backbone conformations and rigid-body orientations over the receptor surface of a given binding site. The subsequent all-atom refinement of the coarse-grained models includes full side-chain modeling of both the receptor and the peptide, resulting in high-resolution models in which key side-chain interactions are recapitulated. The protocol was applied to a benchmark in which peptides were modeled over receptors in either their bound backbone conformations or in their free, unbound form. Near-native peptide conformations were identified in 18/26 of the bound cases and 7/14 of the unbound cases. The protocol performs well on peptides from various classes of secondary structures, including coiled peptides with unusual turns and kinks. The results presented here significantly extend the scope of state-of-the-art methods for high-resolution peptide modeling, which can now be applied to a wide variety of peptide-protein interactions where no prior information about the peptide backbone conformation is available, enabling detailed structure-based studies and manipulation of those interactions.</p>
